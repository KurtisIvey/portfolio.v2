            Hi, my name is Kurtis and I enjoy creating websites from scratch. My
            interest in coding originally started while I was an over the road
            truck driver/instructor for about 5 years. Unfortunately, trucking
            is not conducive to a good marital life. Because of this, I sought
            out an alternative career. Once my wife successfully immigrated from
            Jamaica to the USA, I needed a game plan for the future and chose
            coding.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Fast forward to the end of my trucking career, I decided to pursue
            an education and eventually went down the path of a self taught
            developer. I utilized resources such as Google, Youtube,
            Freecodecamp, Udemy, docs,The Odin Project, etc... to further my
            skills.
