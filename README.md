A new and updated portfolio website to give a more current display of my skillset and new projects. It is built with react and styled with tailwind. I opted to use react as I hadn't used it much in the past few months due to developing primarily server side, so I wanted to refresh my skills with it. In addition, I'm trying to build fluency with tailwind due to it speeding up one of the most time consuming aspects of my development(styling). Ensuring the proper responsiveness with tailwind was probably the most difficult part of this as I used the default width only breakpoints. This was very apparent to me once I flipped devices into landscape mode. So I opted to remove snap which was originally present and stay with smooth scroll features only.

- [ ] React smooth scroll is added for navigation
- [ ] The snap feature is utilized via the use of tailwind and present in the project section to allow for scrolling.
- [ ] A contact form is integrated into the page via emailJs that forwards the form content directly to my email
